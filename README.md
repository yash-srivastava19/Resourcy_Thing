## Artificial Intelligence Notes.
I've curated a list of topics that I personally liked from the book : *Artificial Intelligence-A Modern Approach* (by Russel, Norvig) and made short notes to get a gist of the idea. It requires some effort from your end and a lot of googling to understand(if it's new). The repository can be found here : (AI Notes Repository)[https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/AI-Notes]

## Papers.
If you are into reading research papers in the field of data science/machine learning and related - check out the list of papers I have collected which in some way or other helped me in some project or an idea. The repository can be found here : (List of Reseach Papers)[https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/Papers]
