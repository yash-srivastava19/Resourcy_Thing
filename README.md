# Resource Thing. 
A Good Repository containing all the resources that you need. Mostly Data Science/Machine Learning and similar. Fork and add ; Create Pull Request. 

## Artificial Intelligence Notes.
I've curated a list of topics that I personally liked from the book : *Artificial Intelligence-A Modern Approach* (by Russel, Norvig) and made short notes to get a gist of the idea. It requires some effort from your end and a lot of googling to understand(if it's new). The repository can be found here : [AI Notes Repository](https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/AI-Notes)

## Papers.
If you are into reading research papers in the field of data science/machine learning and related - check out the list of papers I have collected which in some way or other helped me in some project or an idea. The repository can be found here : [List of Reseach Papers](https://github.com/yash-srivastava19/Papers)

## Data Science Resources.
I'll mention two really good repositories that will be really helpful as they have compiled a lot of resources. Check these out.
- [Data Science Resources-1](https://github.com/cdeweyx/DS-Career-Resources)
- [Data Science Resources-2](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/cracking-the-data-science-interview)
- [Data Science Resources-3](https://github.com/datascienceid/machine-learning-resources) 

## Machine Learning Resources.
- [Kaggle Learn Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
- [Google Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/s/results?q=ML)
- [Books, Videos, Podcasts, Courses and Papers](https://github.com/rueedlinger/ml-resources)

## Deep Learning.
- [Best Textual and Understandable Resource for Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html)

*Word of Caution/Advice* :  Just stick to one thing at a time. Donâ€™t try to do too much at once ! 

Apart from that, many popular ML frameworks have some really good tutorials : 

- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples)
